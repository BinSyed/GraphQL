# GraphQL
A simple implementaion of GraphQL for ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebAPI. Demonstrated using GraphQL Playground Package.

GraphQL or Graph Query Language is an API Standard that was invented and open-sourced by Facebook. It basically is an alternative to REST APIs. GraphQL unlike the tradional REST API, gives the control to the Client so that the Client App / user gets to request for the specific data he wants.
